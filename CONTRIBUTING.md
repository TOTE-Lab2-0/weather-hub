# Contributing

Engineering practices for Weather Hub iteration project. All team members and AI assistants should follow these conventions.

## Team

| Role | Person |
|------|--------|
| Scrum Lead | Tinghong |
| Git Lead | Maia |
| Frontend | Maia, Kanami |
| Backend & Auth | John, Tinghong |

## Branch Naming

Use the following prefixes:

- `feat/` — new feature
- `fix/` — bug fix
- `chore/` — maintenance, config, tooling
- `docs/` — documentation only
- `refactor/` — code change that isn't a fix or feature
- `test/` — adding or updating tests

Examples:
- `feat/auth-routes`
- `feat/saved-locations`
- `fix/weather-api-params`
- `chore/mongodb-setup`

## Git Workflow

1. Always branch off `dev`, never `main`
2. Pull latest dev before starting any work
```bash
   git switch dev
   git pull
   git switch -c feat/your-branch-name
```
3. Keep commits focused and use conventional commit messages
4. Push your branch and open a PR to `dev`
5. Request a review before merging
6. Never push directly to `main` or `dev`

## Commit Messages

Follow the Conventional Commits spec: `<type>(<scope>): <short description>`

Common types:
- `feat` — new feature
- `fix` — bug fix
- `chore` — maintenance, config, tooling
- `docs` — documentation only
- `refactor` — code change that isn't a fix or feature
- `test` — adding or updating tests

Rules:
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- Use imperative mood — "add", not "added" or "adds"
- Lowercase after the colon
- No period at the end

Examples:
- `feat(auth): add signup route with bcrypt hashing`
- `fix(weather): correct API parameter for daily forecast`
- `chore(db): connect MongoDB Atlas to Express server`

## Pull Request Format

```md

```

## Pre-PR Checklist

Before opening a pull request:

1. Pull latest dev and merge into your branch
```bash
   git switch dev
   git pull
   git switch your-branch-name
   git merge dev
```
2. Run `npm install` in both `client/` and `server/` to make sure dependencies are up to date
3. Test your changes locally and confirm nothing is broken
4. Make sure no `console.log` statements are left in your code
5. Push your branch to GitHub
6. Fill out the PR description — Summary, Changes, Testing

## Code Comment Guidelines

1. Comment **why**, not just **what**
2. Use comments only for non-obvious logic
3. Keep comments brief, specific, and direct
4. Avoid comments that simply repeat the code
5. Remove temporary learning comments before finishing the file

## Function Documentation

When adding comments to functions, prefer JSDoc format over inline comments. This gives VS Code the ability to show inline documentation on hover and keeps documentation structured and readable.

```typescript
/**
 * Brief description of what the function does.
 *
 * @param {type} paramName - Description of the parameter
 * @returns {type} Description of what is returned
 *
 * @example
 * functionName(arg1, arg2);
 */
```

Not required for every function — use judgment. Prioritize documenting functions with non-obvious inputs, outputs, or behavior.

## Environment Variables

Never commit `.env` files. Use `.env.example` as a template.

### `/client/.env`
No environment variables needed for the frontend currently.

### `/server/.env`
```
PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_secret
```
